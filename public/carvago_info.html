1. HOW CARVAGO WORKS
• Select car: click “Buy” on Carvago.com and fill in contact + service options.
• CarAudit: after payment, a technician performs a 270-point on-site & document check; you receive a photo report and
decide to proceed.
• Payment: pay by bank transfer or arrange financing (decision in ~30 min).
• Logistics: car is moved to Carvago hub, import-inspected, registered to you, serviced/cleaned, then delivered to your
home, work or pick-up point.
• Handover: keys + plates ready to drive.
• Return: you may return the car within 14 days for any reason (normal use ≤ 200 km; extra km charged 0.01 %/km). The
car must not be modified or damaged; otherwise the refund is reduced by the cost to restore original condition.
• CarAudit sample report link – customers can preview a PDF example (linked as “tento výstup” in the long doc) if they
wish to see what they will get.

on Carvago’s account before the car is dispatched; cash payments at hand-over are not possible under CZ AML rules.
• If you refuse a car that passed CarAudit – the CarAudit fee is not refunded (you already note the refund when Carvago
fails the car, but not this converse case).

• Higher/lower prices reflect strict quality filter (top 10 % of 7.5 M daily ads) + service fee.
• VAT reclaim: “odpočtové” cars allow deduction for VAT payers; rate differences across EU are auto-adjusted.
• Dealer country & rating shown in car card.
• Infotainment language: ask support; Czech retrofit possible via third-party firms.
• EV battery SOH: full test only in OEM service, not part of CarAudit.
• Early loan settlement: allowed anytime; statutory fee ≤ 1 % (≤ 0.5 % if < 1 y to maturity). 

7. Process / Operations
• Delivery-time disclaimer – every promise of a lead time must be followed by:
  - “All delivery times are purely indicative and may lengthen because of unforeseen administrative delays at local or international authorities.” (obligatory wording.)
• CarAudit is compulsory – the inspection cannot be skipped and is not sold as a stand-alone service; it is the foundation of all Carvago guarantees.
• Extra services you can pre-order while the car is in transit (not yet listed):
  - interior deep-clean & odour removal
  - exterior polishing / paint correction
  - A/C servicing & disinfection
  - fluid top-ups
  - any other individual requests handled on demand
• Single customer chore: the buyer’s only in-person duty is to provide a notarised power of attorney so Carvago can complete registration and other formalities.

8. Product / Stock rules
• Eligibility limits for cars in inventory – Carvago lists only vehicles ≤ 13 years old and ≤ 180 000 km; older / higher-mileage cars are excluded because the service fee would outweigh their value and the risk would breach warranty standards.
• Carvago becomes the legal owner before resale – therefore it carries all legal and technical risk (stolen car, finance lien, accidents, etc.) and earns a flat service margin on every car, so there is no incentive to push any specific vehicle.

9. Documentation & contacts checklist(needed once, then reused for financing / registration):
• Private buyer – ID card
• OSVČ – ID + trade licence + (if applicable) VAT registration
• Company – ID of authorised person + extract from Commercial Register + VAT cert
• Foreigner – passport + residence permit
