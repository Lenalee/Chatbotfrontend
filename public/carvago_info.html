Carvago – Concise Knowledge Base

1. HOW CARVAGO WORKS
Carvago.com is an online platform that facilitates the buying and selling of used cars across Europe. Users can select a
car from the website, and Carvago will arrange for its inspection, purchase, and delivery to their home, even if the
vehicle is located in another European country.

Cars can be transported from the following countries: *list here the countries*

Express Interest in a Vehicle:
You show interest in a vehicle by clicking the "buy" button.
Fill in the necessary details and choose additional service parameters, which indicates your interest in the vehicle and
the CarAudit inspection.

CarAudit Inspection:
- Upon payment, Carvago immediately starts verifying the vehicle through the CarAudit service (Certifikovaná prověrka
vozu | CarAudit™ od Carvago.com ).
- The CarAudit is both a physical and document inspection conducted by our or a partner technician.
- It results in a detailed report covering 270 parameters, including VIN verification, detailed photo documentation of
any potential damage, along with recommendations from our expert technician.
- Based on this report, you decide whether the car is attractive to you.

Payment Options:
- After agreeing on your interest in the car, choose whether to pay cash or finance it through a loan.

Finalizing the Purchase:
- Pay the agreed amount for the vehicle and select a delivery location.
- Options include pickup at our location, delivery to your work, or home.

Additional Services:
- You can arrange additional services during transportation, such as favorable insurance, additional polishing, interior
cleaning, air conditioning servicing, or an extended warranty up to 24 months. If you have other requests, feel free to
consult us. We strive to meet your wishes.

Delivery Process:
- Once the car arrives at our logistics center, we ensure importation inspection, register the car to you, perform
agreed tasks (inspection, cleaning, fluid replenishment), and deliver it to the chosen address.

Using Your Car:
- Once you have the keys, you can fully use the car immediately. Everything is settled, and there's no further need for
action.

Return Policy:
- If, for any reason, you're dissatisfied with the vehicle, you can return it within 14 days without having to provide a
reason.

  Operations • Delivery-time disclaimer – every promise of a lead time must be followed by:
  - "All delivery times are purely indicative and may lengthen because of unforeseen administrative delays at local or international authorities."
  (obligatory wording.) • CarAudit is compulsory – the inspection cannot be skipped and is not sold as a stand-alone
  service; it is the foundation of all Carvago guarantees. • Extra services you can pre-order while the car is in
  transit (not yet listed): - interior deep-clean & odour removal - exterior polishing / paint correction - A/C
  servicing & disinfection - fluid top-ups - any other individual requests handled on demand • Single customer chore:
  the buyer's only in-person duty is to provide a notarised power of attorney so Carvago can complete registration and
  other formalities. 8. Product / Stock rules • Eligibility limits for cars in inventory – Carvago lists only vehicles ≤
  13 years old and ≤ 180 000 km; older / higher-mileage cars are excluded because the service fee would outweigh their
  value and the risk would breach warranty standards. • Carvago becomes the legal owner before resale – therefore it
  carries all legal and technical risk (stolen car, finance lien, accidents, etc.) and earns a flat service margin on
  every car, so there is no incentive to push any specific vehicle. 9. Documentation & contacts checklist(needed once,
  then reused for financing / registration): • Private buyer – ID card • OSVČ – ID + trade licence + (if applicable) VAT
  registration • Company – ID of authorised person + extract from Commercial Register + VAT cert • Foreigner – passport
  + residence permit
